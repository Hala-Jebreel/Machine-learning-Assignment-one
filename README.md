##  Problem Overview

We tackled a supervised ML problem:
- **Task:** [Classification / Regression]
- **Dataset:** [Brief description]
- **Target Variable:** `[e.g., "Outcome" for classification, "Price" for regression]`

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

##  Workflow Summary

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Feature encoding / scaling
- Outlier removal

### 2. Model Training
- Split into Train/Test (e.g., 80/20)
- Trained using:
  - [‚úî] Logistic Regression
  - [‚úî] Decision Tree / Random Forest
  - [‚úî] K-Nearest Neighbors
  - [‚úî] SVM / Naive Bayes
- Applied grid search or cross-validation for tuning (if applicable)

### 3. Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score (for classification)
- MAE, RMSE, R¬≤ Score (for regression)
- Confusion matrix and ROC curves (if applicable)

##  Visuals

Generated visualizations for:
- Feature importance
- Learning curves
- Confusion matrices
- Correlation heatmaps

## Results

| Model              | Accuracy / R¬≤ | Notes                         |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression| 92.5%         | Best performance in baseline  |
| Random Forest      | 95.1%         | Tuned model, best overall     |
| SVM                | 90.2%         | Slower, but consistent        |
